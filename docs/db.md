# Database usage

## Database migrations

Database migrations are handled using [`knex.js`](https://knexjs.org/) and can be migrated manually using the following commands:

```sh
npx knex migrate:latest # used to migrate to latest database version
npx knex migrate:up # used to migrate to the next database version
npx knex migrate:down # used to migrate to the previous database version
```

## Table structure

The following tables exist in the `inteli` database.

### `attachments`

`attachments` is a staging ground for files before they're uploaded to IPFS as part of on-chain token creation.
